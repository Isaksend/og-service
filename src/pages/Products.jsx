        <h2>HVAC Filtration</h2>
        <p>
          Our product scope is broad: from high-efficiency air filters, to dust collectors, to gas turbine filtration systems. We offer the most advanced technology and skilled application expertise for cleaning air in facilities and processes as diverse as homes, hospitals, industrial plants, commercial buildings, schools, mailrooms and nuclear reactors, as well as gas turbine and diesel engines.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most common use of air filter products is for commercial, institutional and industrial applications, installed in the Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Coarse filters may be used both as primary air filters to protect HVAC components (coils, fans, duct work) from unnecessary dust build-up or to protect more expensive secondary air filters from premature dust loading and replacement. Pocket filters are used as standard equipment for air handling units in HVAC systems. These filters are classified within the range from F5 up to F9. Due to their robust pocket design they are particularly suited for difficult operating conditions.  
        </p>

          High Performance Air Filtration: Air intake systems for gas turbines, high performance compressors and diesels comprising filtration, cooling and sound attenuation are completed with exhaust gas silencing and acoustic enclosures, providing a complete system for the user, OEM or packager.

        <h2>Air Filtration (Engine)</h2>
        <p>
          The Air Filter element establishes a barrier for the separation of airborne contaminants,
          allowing only clean air to enter the engine. Air filter elements fall into four broad
          categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Automotive. Both round and panel designs, with moulded ends.</li>
          <li>Heavy-Duty Primary. Usually with metal ends, available in both PA (standard) and LL (long-life) models.</li>
          <li>Heavy-Duty Secondary. Used to seal out dirt while the primary filter is being changed.</li>
          <li>Radial Seal. With moulded ends and a reinforced closed end - characterised by ease of service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Air is necessary for successful combustion in your engine. In fact, for efficient
          combustion, a modern diesel engine requires several thousand times as much air as it
          does fuel. Clean air - air almost 100% pure - is critical to engine survival and vital to its
          performance. OG Services will provide you with a single source solution for all
          your air filtration requirements... Replacement Elements... Housings... OE Spares...
